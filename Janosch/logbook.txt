Logbook

Mo 30.3. (2h)
- Attending Introductary lecture (Bredeweg/van Someren)

Fr 3.4. (6h)
- Writing and submitting tender applications to the CyberSym and Cyberfarming projets offered by 
	Roberto Valenti (Assignment 1). 
- Summarizing the ideas and determining the research types of these two projects (Assignment 2).

We 8.4. (2h)
-Attending a lecture about the overall criteria for writing academic papers (van Someren)

Th 9.4. (6h)
- First meeting with Roberto and Quiri; Trying to delimit the project - this however fails and it 
	is agreed to try to find suitable projects in the course of the next week.
- Evaluating the provided 'Omelette du fromage' paper based on the criteria for academic papers 
	(Assignment 3).

Mo 13.4. (5h)
- Lecture about ...logics (van Rooij) and differences in AI research (van Someren)
- Meeting with Quiri; Trying to distinguish two equal projects based on our ideas about the problem 
	domain; We however become unsure about the AI-factor of the projet and agree to spend one more 
	day to try to find suitable projects. I contact Bert Bredeweg and Auke Wiggers for more info 
	on the BSc project and MAS, respectively

Tu 14.4. (8h)
- Searching for papers about the CyberSyn project, AAs and MAS; Reading several pieces and trying 
	to form an overall idea about possible approaches and missing bits. 
- Discussing the idea with Auke and contacting Arnoud Visser for more info on the domain of MAS; 
	Arnoud redirected me to Elise Koster who wrote her bachelor thesis on a comparable topic 
	(religion in hunter-gatherer societies); She could point me to some interesting articles
- Reading some high-level introductory papers in order to find an entry point to the problem
- Starting to collect an annotated bibliography (Assingment 4).

We 15.4. (5h)
- Meeting with Quiri and later with Quiri and Roberto. Elaborating the proposed research 
	directeion and trying to further separate our research questions. New approach: Quiri takes 
	the Venus Project and I will focus on the CyberSyn Project. Problem: On lower levels, they 
	will be quite identical. I don't know whether I will reach the recursion level - So we have 
	to work that out some more.
- Reading some more papers and downloading MASON and NetBeans

Th 16.4. (8h)
- Reading some more papers, dowloading some additional ones:
- Setting up MASON and NetBeans, compiling and running a first tutorial program - but then NetBeans 
	crashes and destroys the entire directory. Clean remove of everything - starting over with 
	MASON and Intellij.

Fr 17.4. (10h)
- Creating an annotated bibliography of the papers found so far and putting them in relation to 
	each other through Research Territory Mapping (RTM). 
- Developping keywords for the project and creating a concept map of the proposed project approach. 
- Writing a problem description draft (max 200w - all points above required for Assignment 4)
- Preparing first things for the project approach presentation.

Sa 18.4. (4h)
- Installing + Setting up Intellij and MASON
- Running the first few tutorials from the MASON tutorial directory and getting used to Java again

Mo 20.4. (5h) 
- Continue working on the MASON tutorials and creating first simple simulations
- Meeting with Roberto and Quiuri, finally dividing the project approaches
- Deciding to switch to Repast (which Quiri chose) to make possible a combination of the code after 
	the end of the project period

We 22.4. (6h)
- Preparing the slides for the Project Proposal Presentation on friday
- Extending literature review for the Project Proposal Assignment due on friday

Do 23.4. (6 1/2h)
- Meeting with Roberto to check the Presentation Slides
- Reading and scanning the remaining found literature and drawing up a draft for the Poject Proposal's 
	Literature Review
- Creating Gantt and PERT charts of project planning

Fr 24.4. (8h)
- Project Proposal Presentation. The presentation went well, my voice however didn't obey me in the 
	beginning (for the first time ever - we will work on that for the next presentation)
- Meeting with Roberto and Quiri to plan the next week
- Writing the Project Proposal (Assignment 6)

Sa 25.4. (1 1/2h)
- Setting up Repast and starting the tutorial

So 26.4. (7 1/2h)
- Completing the tutorial and working on a first attempt to my CyberSym simulation. At the end of the 		day I have basic agents and resources; The agents die over time as they cannot yet get
	resources - and the resources keep regenerating till infinity. But it's a start.

Mo 27.4. (8h)
- Continue to work on the model. At the end of the day, agents can extend their lifespan by mining 	resources untill they are exhausted. Then the same happens as did yesterday - Everyone dies.
- Commenting everything I have done so far
- Setting up Repast on my Laptop
