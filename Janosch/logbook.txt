Logbook

Mo 30.3. (2h)
- Attending Introductary lecture of the Bachelor's project phase (Bredeweg/van Someren)

Fr 3.4. (6h)
- Writing and submitting tender applications to the CyberSym and Cyberfarming projets offered by 
	Roberto Valenti (Assignment 1). 
- Summarizing the ideas and determining the research types of these two projects (Assignment 2).

We 8.4. (2h)
-Attending a lecture about the overall criteria for writing academic papers (van Someren)

Th 9.4. (6h)
- First meeting with Roberto and Quiri; Trying to find two equally demanding aspects in order to
	split the project in two parts and delimit the individual projects - this however fails 
	and it is agreed to try to find suitable projects in the course of the next week.
- Evaluating the provided 'Omelette du fromage' paper based on the criteria for academic papers 
	(Assignment 3).

Mo 13.4. (5h)
- Lecture about non-consistent logics (van Rooij) and differences in AI research (van Someren)
- Meeting with Quiri; Trying to distinguish two equal projects based on our ideas about the problem 
	domain; We however get more and more concerned about the AI-factor of the projet and agree  
	to spend one more day to try to find suitable projects. I contact Bert Bredeweg and Auke  
	Wiggers for more info on the BSc project and MAS, respectively

Tu 14.4. (8h)
- Searching for papers about the CyberSyn project, AAs and MAS; Reading several pieces and trying 
	to form an overall idea about possible approaches and missing bits. 
- Discussing the idea with Auke and contacting Arnoud Visser for more info on the domain of MAS; 
	Arnoud redirected me to Elise Koster who wrote her bachelor thesis on a comparable topic 
	(religion in hunter-gatherer societies); She could point me to some interesting articles
- Reading some high-level introductory papers in order to find an entry point to the problem
- Starting to collect an annotated bibliography (Assingment 4).

We 15.4. (5h)
- Meeting with Quiri and later with Quiri and Roberto. Elaborating the proposed research 
	directeion and trying to further separate our research questions. New approach: Quiri takes 
	the Venus Project and I will focus on the CyberSyn Project. Problem: On lower levels, they 
	will be quite identical. I don't know whether I will reach the recursion level - So we have 
	to work that out some more.
- Reading some more papers and downloading MASON and NetBeans

Th 16.4. (8h)
- Reading some more papers and dowloading some additional ones
- Setting up MASON and NetBeans, compiling and running a first tutorial program - but then NetBeans 
	crashes and destroys the entire directory. Clean remove of everything - starting over with 
	MASON and Intellij.

Fr 17.4. (10h)
- Creating an annotated bibliography of the papers found so far and putting them in relation to 
	each other through Research Territory Mapping (RTM). 
- Developping keywords for the project and creating a concept map of the proposed project approach. 
- Writing a problem description draft (max 200 words - all points above required for Assignment 4)
- Preparing first things for the project approach presentation.

Sa 18.4. (4h)
- Installing + Setting up Intellij and MASON
- Running the first few tutorials from the MASON tutorial directory and getting used to Java again

Mo 20.4. (5h) 
- Continue working on the MASON tutorials and creating first simple simulations
- Meeting with Roberto and Quiuri and finally dividing the project approaches: I will focus on the 
	distribution of resources and products in the agent network, Quiri will have a look at the
	demand/supply regulation 
- Deciding to switch to Repast (which Quiri chose) to make possible a combination of the code after 
	the end of the project period

We 22.4. (6h)
- Preparing the slides for the Project Proposal Presentation on friday
- Extending literature review for the Project Proposal Assignment due on friday

Do 23.4. (6 1/2h)
- Meeting with Roberto to check the Presentation Slides
- Reading and scanning the remaining found literature and drawing up a draft for the Poject Proposal's 
	Literature Review
- Creating Gantt and PERT charts of project planning

Fr 24.4. (8h)
- Project Proposal Presentation. The presentation went well, my voice however didn't obey me in the 
	beginning (for the first time ever - we will work on that for the next presentation)
- Meeting with Roberto and Quiri to plan the next week
- Writing the Project Proposal (Assignment 6)

Sa 25.4. (1 1/2h)
- Setting up Repast and start working on the tutorial

So 26.4. (7 1/2h)
- Completing the tutorial 
- Working on a first attempt to my CyberSym simulation. At the end of the day I have basic agents and 
	resources; The agents die in the course of time as they cannot yet get any resources - and the
	resources keep regenerating till infinity. But it's a start.
	Design choices so far: I implemented different classes for the Agents, Resources and Sources
	(the locations where Resources spawn and can be extracted by the Agents). Resources are 
	represented by letters of the english alphabet that in the next steps can be used to assemble
	products to be consumed by the agents. The Resource class is necessary as a resource has much
	more features than just its resource type. 

Mo 27.4. (6h)
- Continue to work on the model. At the end of the day, agents can extend their lifespan by mining 	
	resources untill they are exhausted. Then the same happens as did yesterday - Everyone dies.
	Sources may regenrate at a given (randomized) rate, Agents can extract one Resource unit per
	cycle. Extracting a resource costs the equivalent of the pyhtagorean distance between Agent 
	and Source. The environment grid "wraps around" so that its border connect to those on the 
	opposite side of the grid. The environment thus effectively forms a globe.
- Commenting everything I have done so far
- Setting up Repast on my Laptop 

Tu 28.4. (6 1/2h)
- Further work on the model. Adding a function to read a comma separated list of words from a file in
	order to create the possible products that can be assembled by the agents. Implementing a
	Product class to hold the features of an assembled product. Updating Resource and Agent class
	to add the possibility of creating products and starting to work on functions to assemble pro-
	ducts from Resources. 

We 29.4. (7h)
- Adding functions for combining basic Resources to partial products, combining Resources and partial
	Products as well as combining Product parts themselves. Implementing functions to generate 
	a list of all indirect demands that can be derived from the Product demand.  

Th 30.4. (7 1/2h)
- Updating the different classes to fully incorporate the production of assembled items and the 
	consumption thereof. Experimenting with the built-in visualisation tools of Repast and genera-
	ting a number of different visualisations. Debugging some of the functionalities

Fr 1.5. (6h)
- Implementing a first linear decision mechanism. Developing a useful order and fixing some issues that
	arose through paralellity (some instances were not yet instantiated when called by other in-
	stances etc.

Sa 2.5. (5h)
- Finishing a first working version of the simulation without Agent communication. Agents now survive as
	long as there are sufficient Resources in their environment. When there is scarcity or the 
	Agents exhaust the Sources, they die. 
- Redesigning some of the funtions to make them more efficient with respect to recent changes to the 
	different classes

Mo 4.5. (3h)
- Implementing first functions for Agent communication. Agents may now request Resources that are not 
	within their reach

Tu 5.5. (4h)
- Adding the transport of basic Resources. Agents may now also decide to extract a resource for one of 
	their neighbors and deliver it to him.

We 6.5. (9 1/2h)
- Implementing a customized bar chart to visualise demand, supply, request and depletion of resources.
	This was far more complicated than necessary and still may be optimized, but it gives a good
	first idea about what is happening in the system.
- Optimizing some functionalities to better make use of new forms of datastructures 
- Commenting all new functionality
