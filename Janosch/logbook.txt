Logbook

Mo 30.3. (2h)
- Attending Introductary lecture (Bredeweg/van Someren)

Fr 3.4. (6h)
- Writing and submitting tender applications to the CyberSym and Cyberfarming projets offered by 
	Roberto Valenti (Assignment 1). 
- Summarizing the ideas and determining the research types of these two projects (Assignment 2).

We 8.4. (2h)
-Attending a lecture about the overall criteria for writing academic papers (van Someren)

Th 9.4. (6h)
- First meeting with Roberto and Quiri; Trying to delimit the project - this however fails and it 
	is agreed to try to find suitable projects in the course of the next week.
- Evaluating the provided 'Omelette du fromage' paper based on the criteria for academic papers 
	(Assignment 3).

Mo 13.4. (5h)
- Lecture about ...logics (van Rooij) and differences in AI research (van Someren)
- Meeting with Quiri; Trying to distinguish two equal projects based on our ideas about the problem 
	domain; We however become unsure about the AI-factor of the projet and agree to spend one more 
	day to try to find suitable projects. I contact Bert Bredeweg and Auke Wiggers for more info 
	on the BSc project and MAS, respectively

Tu 14.4. (8h)
- Searching for papers about the CyberSyn project, AAs and MAS; Reading several pieces and trying 
	to form an overall idea about possible approaches and missing bits. 
- Discussing the idea with Auke and contacting Arnoud Visser for more info on the domain of MAS; 
	Arnoud redirected me to Elise Koster who wrote her bachelor thesis on a comparable topic 
	(religion in hunter-gatherer societies); She could point me to some interesting articles
- Reading some high-level introductory papers in order to find an entry point to the problem
- Starting to collect an annotated bibliography (Assingment 4).

We 15.4. (5h)
- Meeting with Quiri and later with Quiri and Roberto. Elaborating the proposed research 
	directeion and trying to further separate our research questions. New approach: Quiri takes 
	the Venus Project and I will focus on the CyberSyn Project. Problem: On lower levels, they 
	will be quite identical. I don't know whether I will reach the recursion level - So we have 
	to work that out some more.
- Reading some more papers and downloading MASON and NetBeans

Th 16.4. (8h)
- Reading some more papers, dowloading some additional ones:
- Setting up MASON and NetBeans, compiling and running a first tutorial program - but then NetBeans 
	crashes and destroys the entire directory. Clean remove of everything - starting over with 
	MASON and Intellij.

Fr 17.4. (10h)
- Creating an annotated bibliography of the papers found so far and putting them in relation to 
	each other through Research Territory Mapping (RTM). 
- Developping keywords for the project and creating a concept map of the proposed project approach. 
- Writing a problem description draft (max 200w - all points above required for Assignment 4)
- Preparing first things for the project approach presentation.
